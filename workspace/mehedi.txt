(Verse 1)
In fields of green, where dreams reside,
A melody flows, a gentle tide.
With hearts entwined, we sing our song,
In Mehedi's embrace, where we belong.

(Chorus)
Mehedi, Mehedi, a name so sweet,
A rhythm of love, a joyful beat.
Through sun and rain, our spirits soar,
Mehedi, Mehedi, forevermore.

(Verse 2)
Beneath the stars, our voices blend,
A tapestry of stories, without end.
With every note, a memory made,
In Mehedi's light, our hearts are swayed.

(Chorus)
Mehedi, Mehedi, a name so sweet,
A rhythm of love, a joyful beat.
Through sun and rain, our spirits soar,
Mehedi, Mehedi, forevermore.

(Bridge)
Like petals dancing in the breeze,
Our souls take flight, with graceful ease.
In this moment, we find our peace,
In Mehedi's arms, our worries cease.

(Chorus)
Mehedi, Mehedi, a name so sweet,
A rhythm of love, a joyful beat.
Through sun and rain, our spirits soar,
Mehedi, Mehedi, forevermore.

(Outro)
In Mehedi's name, our voices rise,
A symphony of love, that never dies.
Forever grateful, for this sacred space,
Mehedi, Mehedi, a timeless grace.
