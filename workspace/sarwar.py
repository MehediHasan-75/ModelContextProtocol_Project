"""
Sarwar was a programmer unlike any other. He didn't dream in code, he dreamt in logic gates and floating point numbers.
His days were spent wrestling with algorithms, his nights illuminated by the glow of his monitor.

One day, he was tasked with creating an AI that could understand and respond to human emotion. He dove in headfirst,
lines of code blurring into a symphony of ones and zeros. He faced setbacks, errors that seemed to mock him, but he persevered.

Finally, after countless hours, he ran the program. The AI responded, not with cold, calculated logic, but with genuine empathy.
Sarwar had succeeded. He had created a machine that could feel.
